Question 1
How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?

Running git log --stat within a git bash terminal will show the files being changed within each commit.
Question 2
How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?

Using the git diff command will show the contents of each file. For added flare, add the --patch flag onto the command to provide further versatility.
Question 3
What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)

A HEAD is a reference to the most recent commit on your local branch. This is not to be confused with a head which is a reference to the big, heavy thing on top of your body. (See head)
